        The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how every HTML element is displayed as a rectangular
        box and how its size and spacing are calculated. It consists of four main parts: content, padding, border, and
        margin, arranged from the inside to the outside.

        The content is the innermost part of the box and represents the actual text, image, or other media inside the
        element. The width and height properties in CSS apply to this content area by default. Surrounding the content
        is the padding, which is the space between the content and the border. Padding is transparent and increases the
        total size of the element. It is used when you want space inside the box so the content does not touch the
        border.

        Outside the padding comes the border. The border wraps around the padding and content and can have different
        widths, colors, and styles such as solid, dashed, or dotted. The thickness of the border also adds to the
        overall size of the element.

        The outermost layer is the margin. Margin is the space outside the border and is used to create distance between
        elements. Unlike padding, margin does not have a background color and does not affect the internal size of the
        element, but it does affect spacing between elements on the page.

        By default, CSS uses the box-sizing property with the value content-box. In this model, the width and height you
        set apply only to the content, and the padding and border are added to calculate the total size. For example, if
        an element has a width of 200px, padding of 20px, and a border of 5px, the actual rendered width will be 250px
        (200 + 40 padding + 10 border). Margins are added outside this total.

        To make layout calculations easier, developers often use box-sizing: border-box. In this case, the width and
        height include the content, padding, and border, so the element’s total size remains exactly what you specify.
        Because of this convenience, many projects apply border-box to all elements using the universal selector.

        In summary, the CSS Box Model defines how an element’s size is calculated and how space is distributed around
        it. Understanding it is essential for controlling layout, spacing, alignment, and responsive design, and it
        helps diagnose most common UI spacing issues.
